# vue-slider-for-anniversary

A cute little image slider display, which will contain some text talking about our 1 year together so far! ❤️

## Left to do:
1. make sure the images don't overflow and actually fit properly to the size of the browser window.
2. add a text display for each Slide component, so i can fill them with descriptions of our journey so far.
3. possibly tweak how the next/prev slide button look and function, they seem a bit unresponsive sometimes.
4. hopefully be able to add some slow reveal of the text, so it looks nice, so it like fades in like it's being written in real-time.
5. find and add all the pictures i want, from Germany, Hven, just at home, and all that stuff.
6. figure out the "storyline" for the flow of the pictures, make it make sense and have a nice and cute ending.
