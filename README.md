# vue-slider-for-anniversary

A cute little image slider display, which will contain some text talking about our 1 year together so far! ❤️

## Left to do:
- [x] Make sure the images don't overflow and actually fit properly to the size of the browser window.
- [x] Add a text display for each Slide component, so i can fill them with descriptions of our journey so far.
- [x] Hopefully be able to add some slow reveal of the text, so it looks nice, so it like fades in like it's being written in real-time.
- [x] Find and add all the pictures i want, from Germany, Hven, just at home, and all that stuff.
- [x] Figure out the "storyline" for the flow of the pictures, make it make sense and have a nice and cute ending.
- [x] Make sure the images cant be selected, it happens sometimes and makes it look weird.
- [x] Create bg-9, with a background of us and some icons of like babies, dogs, and marriage stuff, to show the future stuff.
- [x] Move slider-view to a new route, and add a home page with more of a reveal page for the slide.
- [x] For the new home view, create a button to the slider that looks like a little gift opening up.
- [ ] See if i can deploy to like Vercel or something similar, would be cool to have it fully hosted.
