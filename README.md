# vue-slider-for-anniversary

A cute little image slider display, which will contain some text talking about our 1 year together so far! ❤️

## Left to do:
- [x] Make sure the images don't overflow and actually fit properly to the size of the browser window.
- [ ] Add a text display for each Slide component, so i can fill them with descriptions of our journey so far.
- [ ] Possibly tweak how the next/prev slide button look and function, they seem a bit unresponsive sometimes.
- [ ] Hopefully be able to add some slow reveal of the text, so it looks nice, so it like fades in like it's being written in real-time.
- [ ] Find and add all the pictures i want, from Germany, Hven, just at home, and all that stuff.
- [ ] Figure out the "storyline" for the flow of the pictures, make it make sense and have a nice and cute ending.
